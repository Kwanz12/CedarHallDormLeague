                <p>DISCLAIMERS!!

                    Your aim is always to be better than the previous captain because  the aim of dorm league is to build leaders. Therefore you can hold training sessions, squad meetings, anything. <br>
                    
                    Transfer season is in October and ends in November both captains have to agree that the player is not a slave and therefore has a say in the matter. <br>
                    
                    To decide the man of the match the sports director and the two captains that played the match and the sports director will decide the man of the match and if a decision is not made between the three of us we will invite the referee to make a decision but he will have to choose from the names we have selected.<br>
                    
                    If there is a request for a time change, both captains will have to agree on that time change, if no agreement is reached then the match will be played at the original time that was set. <br>
